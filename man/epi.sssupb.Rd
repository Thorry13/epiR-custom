\note{
Consider a clinical trial comparing two groups, a standard treatment (s) and a new treatment (n). In each group, a proportion of subjects respond to the treatment: \eqn{P_{s}} and \eqn{P_{n}}. 

With a superiority trial we specify the maximum acceptable difference between \eqn{P_{n}} and \eqn{P_{s}} as \eqn{\delta}. TThe null hypothesis is \eqn{H_{0}: P_{n} - P_{s} \leq \delta} and the alternative hypothesis is \eqn{H_{1}: P_{n} - P_{s} > \delta}.

An equivalence trial is used if want to prove that two treatments produce the same clinical outcomes. With an equivalence trial, we specify the maximum acceptable difference between \eqn{P_{n}} and \eqn{P_{s}} as \eqn{\delta}. The null hypothesis is \eqn{H_{0}: |P_{s} - P_{n}| \geq \delta} and the alternative hypothesis is \eqn{H_{1}: |P_{s} - P_{n}| < \delta}. In bioequivalence trials, a 90\% confidence interval is often used. The value of the maximum acceptable difference \eqn{\delta} is chosen so that a patient will not detect any change in effect when replacing the standard treatment with the new treatment.

With a non-inferiority trial, we specify the maximum acceptable difference between \eqn{P_{n}} and \eqn{P_{s}} as \eqn{\delta}. The null hypothesis is \eqn{H_{0}: P_{s} - P_{n} \geq \delta} and the alternative hypothesis is \eqn{H_{1}: P_{s} - P_{n} < \delta}. The aim of a non-inferiority trial is show that a new treatment is not (much) inferior to a standard treatment. Showing non-inferiority can be of interest because: (a) it is often not ethically possible to do a placebo-controlled trial, (b) the new treatment is not expected to be better than the standard treatment on primary efficacy endpoints, but is safer, (c) the new treatment is not expected to be better than the standard treatment on primary efficacy endpoints, but is cheaper to produce or easier to administer, (d) the new treatment is not expected to be better than the standard treatment on primary efficacy endpoints in clinical trial, but compliance will be better outside the clinical trial and hence efficacy better outside the trial.

For a summary of the key features of superiority, equivalence and non-inferiority trials, refer to the documentation for \code{\link{epi.ssequb}}.

When calculating the power of a study, note that the variable \code{n} refers to the total study size (that is, the number of subjects in the treatment group plus the number in the control group).

## EXAMPLE 1 (from Chow S, Shao J, Wang H 2008, p. 91):
## Suppose that a pharmaceutical company is interested in conducting a
## clinical trial to compare the efficacy of two antimicrobial agents 
## when administered orally once daily in the treatment of patients 
## with skin infections. In what follows, we consider the situation 
## where the intended trial is for testing superiority of the 
## test drug over the active control drug. For this purpose, the following 
## assumptions are made. First, sample size calculation will be performed 
## for achieving 80\% power at the 5\% level of significance.

## Assume the true mean cure rates of the treatment agents and the active 
## control are 85\% and 65\%, respectively. Assume the superiority
## margin is 5\%.

epi.sssupb(treat = 0.85, control = 0.65, delta = 0.05, n = NA, 
   r = 1, power = 0.80, nfractional = FALSE, alpha = 0.05)

## A total of 196 subjects need to be enrolled in the trial, 98 in the 
## treatment group and 98 in the control group.
