\note{
Consider a clinical trial comparing two groups, a standard treatment (s) and a new treatment (n). In each group, a proportion of subjects respond to the treatment: \eqn{P_{s}} and \eqn{P_{n}}. 

With a superiority trial we specify the maximum acceptable difference between \eqn{P_{n}} and \eqn{P_{s}} as \eqn{\delta}. The null hypothesis is \eqn{H_{0}: P_{n} - P_{s} \leq \delta} and the alternative hypothesis is \eqn{H_{1}: P_{n} - P_{s} > \delta}.

An equivalence trial is used if want to prove that two treatments produce the same clinical outcomes. With an equivalence trial, we specify the maximum acceptable difference between \eqn{P_{n}} and \eqn{P_{s}} as \eqn{\delta}. The null hypothesis is \eqn{H_{0}: |P_{s} - P_{n}| \geq \delta} and the alternative hypothesis is \eqn{H_{1}: |P_{s} - P_{n}| < \delta}. In bioequivalence trials, a 90\% confidence interval is often used. The value of the maximum acceptable difference \eqn{\delta} is chosen so that a patient will not detect any change in effect when replacing the standard treatment with the new treatment.

With a non-inferiority trial, we specify the maximum acceptable difference between \eqn{P_{n}} and \eqn{P_{s}} as \eqn{\delta}. The null hypothesis is \eqn{H_{0}: P_{s} - P_{n} \geq \delta} and the alternative hypothesis is \eqn{H_{1}: P_{s} - P_{n} < \delta}. The aim of a non-inferiority trial is show that a new treatment is not (much) inferior to a standard treatment. Showing non-inferiority can be of interest because: (a) it is often not ethically possible to do a placebo-controlled trial, (b) the new treatment is not expected to be better than the standard treatment on primary efficacy endpoints, but is safer, (c) the new treatment is not expected to be better than the standard treatment on primary efficacy endpoints, but is cheaper to produce or easier to administer, (d) the new treatment is not expected to be better than the standard treatment on primary efficacy endpoints in clinical trial, but compliance will be better outside the clinical trial and hence efficacy better outside the trial.

For a summary of the key features of superiority, equivalence and non-inferiority trials, refer to the documentation for \code{\link{epi.ssequb}}. 

When calculating the power of a study, note that the variable \code{n} refers to the total study size (that is, the number of subjects in the treatment group plus the number in the control group).

\examples{
## EXAMPLE 1:
## A pharmaceutical company is interested in conducting a clinical trial
## to compare two cholesterol lowering agents for treatment of patients with
## congestive heart disease (CHD) using a parallel design. The primary 
## efficacy parameter is the concentration of high density lipoproteins.
## (HDL). We consider the situation where the intended trial is to test 
## superiority of the test drug over the active control agent. Sample 
## size calculations are to be calculated to achieve 80\% power at the
## 5\% level of significance.

## In this example, we assume that if treatment results in a 5 unit 
## (i.e. delta = 5) increase in HDL it is declared to be superior to the
## active control. Assume the standard deviation of HDL is 10 units and 
## the HDL concentration in the treatment group is 20 units and the 
## HDL concentration in the control group is 20 units.

epi.sssupc(treat = 20, control = 20, sd = 10, delta = 5, n = NA, 
   r = 1, power = 0.80, nfractional = FALSE, alpha = 0.05)

## A total of 100 subjects need to be enrolled in the trial, 50 in the 
## treatment group and 50 in the control group.
