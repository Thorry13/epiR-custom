The point estimates of the \code{wald}, \code{score} and \code{cfield} odds ratios are calculated using the cross product method. Method \code{mle} computes the conditional maximum likelihood estimate of the odds ratio.

Confidence intervals for the Cornfield (\code{cfield}) odds ratios are computed using the hypergeometric distribution and computation times are extremely slow when the cell frequencies are large. For this reason, Cornfield confidence intervals are only calculated if the total number of event frequencies is less than 500.

The Mantel-Haenszel chi-squared test that the combined odds ratio estimate is equal to 1 uses a two-sided test without continuity correction.

\note{Measures of association include the prevalence ratio, the incidence risk ratio, the incidence rate ratio and the odds ratio. The incidence risk ratio is the ratio of the incidence risk of disease in the exposed group to the incidence risk of disease in the unexposed group. The odds ratio (also known as the cross-product ratio) is an estimate of the incidence risk ratio. When the incidence of an outcome in the study population is low (say, less than 5\%) the odds ratio will provide a reliable estimate of the incidence risk ratio. The more frequent the outcome becomes, the more the odds ratio will overestimate the incidence risk ratio when it is greater than than 1 or understimate the incidence risk ratio when it is less than 1.

Measures of effect in the exposed include the attributable risk (or prevalence) and the attributable fraction. The attributable risk is the risk of disease in the exposed group minus the risk of disease in the unexposed group. The attributable risk provides a measure of the absolute increase or decrease in risk associated with exposure. The attributable fraction is the proportion of study outcomes in the exposed group that is attributable to exposure. 

Measures of effect in the population include the population attributable risk (or prevalence) and the population attributable fraction (also known as the aetiologic fraction). The population attributable risk is the risk of the study outcome in the population that may be attributed to exposure. The population attributable fraction is the proportion of the study outcomes in the population that is attributable to exposure.

Point estimates and confidence intervals for the prevalence ratio and incidence risk ratio are calculated using Wald (Wald 1943) and score methods (Miettinen and Nurminen 1985). Point estimates and confidence intervals for the incidence rate ratio are calculated using the exact method described by Kirkwood and Sterne (2003) and Juul (2004). Point estimates and confidence intervals the odds ratio are calculated using Wald (Wald 1943), score (Miettinen and Nurminen 1985) and maximum likelihood methods (Fleiss et al. 2003). Point estimates and confidence intervals for the population attributable risk are calculated using formulae provided by Rothman and Greenland (1998, p 271) and Pirikahu (2014). Point estimates and confidence intervals for the population attributable fraction are calculated using formulae provided by Jewell (2004, p 84 - 85). Point estimates and confidence intervals for the Mantel-Haenszel adjusted attributable risk are calculated using formulae provided by Klingenberg (2014).

Wald confidence intervals are provided in the summary table simply because they are widely used and would be familiar to most users. 

The Mantel-Haenszel adjusted measures of association are valid when the measures of association across the different strata are similar (homogenous), that is when the test of homogeneity of the odds (risk) ratios is not significant.

The Mantel-Haenszel (Woolf) test of homogeneity of the odds ratio are based on Jewell (2004, p 152 - 158). Thanks to Jim Robison-Cox for sharing his implementation of these functions.

## EXAMPLE 1:
## A cross sectional study investigating the relationship between dry cat 
## food (DCF) and feline urologic syndrome (FUS) was conducted (Willeberg 
## 1977). Counts of individuals in each group were as follows:

## DCF-exposed cats (cases, non-cases) 13, 2163
## Non DCF-exposed cats (cases, non-cases) 5, 3349

## Outcome variable (FUS) as columns:
dat <- matrix(c(13,2163,5,3349), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)
rownames(dat) <- c("DF+", "DF-"); colnames(dat) <- c("FUS+", "FUS-"); dat

epi.2by2(dat = as.table(dat), method = "cross.sectional", 
   conf.level = 0.95, units = 100, outcome = "as.columns")

## Outcome variable (FUS) as rows:
dat <- matrix(c(13,5,2163,3349), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)
rownames(dat) <- c("FUS+", "FUS-"); colnames(dat) <- c("DF+", "DF-"); dat

epi.2by2(dat =  as.table(dat), method = "cross.sectional", 
   conf.level = 0.95, units = 100, outcome = "as.rows")

## Prevalence ratio:
## The prevalence of FUS in DCF exposed cats is 4.01 (95\% CI 1.43 to 11.23) 
## times greater than the prevalence of FUS in non-DCF exposed cats.

## Attributable fraction in the exposed:
## In DCF exposed cats, 75\% of FUS is attributable to DCF (95\% CI 30\% to 
## 91\%).

## Attributable fraction in the population:
## Fifty-four percent of FUS cases in the cat population are attributable 
## to DCF (95\% CI 4\% to 78\%).

## EXAMPLE 2:
## This example shows how the table function can be used to pass data to
## epi.2by2. Here we use the birthwgt data from the MASS package.

library(MASS)
dat1 <- birthwt; head(dat1)

## Generate a table of cell frequencies. First set the levels of the outcome 
## and the exposure so the frequencies in the 2 by 2 table come out in the 
## conventional format:
dat1$low <- factor(dat1$low, levels = c(1,0))
dat1$smoke <- factor(dat1$smoke, levels = c(1,0))
dat1$race <- factor(dat1$race, levels = c(1,2,3))

## Generate the 2 by 2 table. Exposure (rows) = smoke. Outcome (columns) = low.
tab1 <- table(dat1$smoke, dat1$low, dnn = c("Smoke", "Low BW"))
print(tab1)

## Compute the incidence risk ratio and other measures of association:
epi.2by2(dat = tab1, method = "cohort.count", 
   conf.level = 0.95, units = 100, outcome = "as.columns")

## Odds ratio:
## The odds of having a low birth weight child for smokers is 2.02 
## (95\% CI 1.08 to 3.78) times greater than the odds of having a low birth 
## weight child for non-smokers.

## Now stratify by race:
tab2 <- table(dat1$smoke, dat1$low, dat1$race, 
   dnn = c("Smoke", "Low BW", "Race"))
print(tab2)

## Compute the crude odds ratio, the Mantel-Haenszel adjusted odds ratio 
## and other measures of association:
rval <- epi.2by2(dat = tab2, method = "cohort.count", 
   conf.level = 0.95, units = 100, outcome = "as.columns")
print(rval)

## The Mantel-Haenszel test of homogeneity of the strata odds ratios is not 
## significant (chi square test statistic 2.800; df 2; p-value = 0.25). 
## We accept the null hypothesis and conclude that the odds ratios for 
## each strata of race are the same. 

## After accounting for the confounding effect of race, the odds of 
## having a low birth weight child for smokers is 3.09 (95\% CI 1.49 to 6.39)
## times that of non-smokers.

## Compare the Greenland-Robins confidence intervals for the Mantel-Haenszel
## adjusted attributable risk with the Wald confidence intervals for the 
## Mantel-Haenszel adjusted attributable risk:

rval$massoc$ARisk.mh.green
rval$massoc$ARisk.mh.wald

## Now turn tab2 into a data frame where the frequencies of individuals in 
## each exposure-outcome category are provided. Often your data will be 
## presented in this summary format:
dat2 <- data.frame(tab2)
print(dat2)

## Re-format dat2 (a summary count data frame) into tabular format using the 
## xtabs function:
tab3 <- xtabs(Freq ~ Smoke + Low.BW + Race, data = dat2)
print(tab3)

# tab3 can now be passed to epi.2by2:
rval <- epi.2by2(dat = tab3, method = "cohort.count", 
   conf.level = 0.95, units = 100, outcome = "as.columns")
print(rval)

## The Mantel-Haenszel adjusted odds ratio is 3.09 (95\% CI 1.49 to 6.39). The 
## ratio of the crude odds ratio to the Mantel-Haensel adjusted odds ratio is
## 0.66.

## What are the Cornfield confidence limits, the maximum likelihood 
## confidence limits and the score confidence limits for the crude odds ratio?
rval$massoc$OR.crude.cfield
rval$massoc$OR.crude.mle
rval$massoc$OR.crude.score

## Cornfield: 2.02 (95\% CI 1.07 to 3.79)
## Maximum likelihood: 2.01 (1.03 to 3.96)

## EXAMPLE 3:
## A study was conducted by Feychting et al (1998) comparing cancer occurrence

## severe visual impairment. From these data we calculate a cancer rate of

## years among those who were visually impaired but not blind.

## The incidence rate of cancer was 7.22 cases per 1000 person-years less in the

## (90\% CI 6.00 to 8.43 cases per 1000 person-years).

round(summary(rval)$IRR.strata.wald, digits = 2)
}

## The incidence rate of cancer in the blind group was less than half that of the 
## comparison group (incidence rate ratio 0.46, 90\% CI 0.38 to 0.55).

## EXAMPLE 4:
## A study has been conducted to assess the effect of a new treatment for 
## mastitis in dairy cows. Eight herds took part in the study. The following 
## data were obtained. The vectors ai, bi, ci and di list (for each herd) the 
## number of cows in the E+D+, E+D-, E-D+ and E-D- groups, respectively.

di <- c(6,4,3,2,6,3,1,1)
dat <- data.frame(hid, ai, bi, ci, di)

## Re-format data frame dat into a format suitable for epi.2by2:
hid <- rep(1:8, times = 4)
exp <- factor(rep(c(1,1,0,0), each = 8), levels = c(1,0))

dat <- xtabs(n ~ exp + out + hid, data = dat)
print(dat)

epi.2by2(dat = dat, method = "cohort.count", outcome= "as.columns")

## The Mantel-Haenszel test of homogeneity of the strata odds ratios is not 
## significant (chi square test statistic 5.276; df 7; p-value = 0.63). 
## We accept the null hypothesis and conclude that the odds ratios for each

## After adjusting for the effect of herd, compared to untreated cows, treatment
## increased the odds of recovery by a factor of 5.97 (95\% CI 2.72 to 13.13).
