\title{Relative excess risk due to interaction in a case-control study}

\description{
For two binary explanatory variables included in a logistic regression as an interaction term, computes the relative excess risk due to interaction, the proportion of outcomes among those with both exposures attributable to interaction, and the synergy index. Confidence interval calculations are based on the delta method described by Hosmer and Lemeshow (1992).

\usage{
epi.interaction(model, coef, param = c("product", "dummy"), 
   type = c("RERI", "APAB", "S"), conf.level = 0.95)
}

\arguments{
  \item{model}{an object of class \code{glm}, \code{clogit} or \code{coxph}.}
  \item{coef}{a vector listing the positions of the coefficients of the interaction terms in the model. What row numbers of the regression table summary list the coefficients for the interaction terms included in the model? }
  \item{param}{character stringing specifying the type of coding used for the variables included in the interaction term. Options are \code{product} where two risk factors and one product term are used to represent the interaction and \code{dummy} where the two risk factors are combined into a single variable with four levels. See the examples, below, for details.}
  \item{type}{character string specifying the type of analysis to be run. Options are \code{RERI} the relative excess risk due to interaction, \code{APAB} the proportion of disease among those with both exposures that is attributable to interaction of the two exposures, and \code{S} the synergy index.}
  \item{conf.level}{magnitude of the returned confidence interval. Must be a single number between 0 and 1.}

\details{
Interaction on an additive scale means that the combined effect of two exposures is greater (or less) than the sum of the individual effects of two exposures. Interaction on a multiplicative scale means that the combined effect of the two exposures is greater (or less) than the product of the individual effects of the two exposures.

This function calculates three indices to assess the presence of additive interaction, as defined by Rothman (1998): (1) the relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI, sometimes called the interaction contrast ratio), (2) the proportion of disease among those with both exposures that is attributable to their interaction (AP[AB]), and (3) the synergy index (S). 

A RERI of zero  means no additive interaction. A RERI of greater than one means positive interaction or more than additivity. A RERI of less than one means negative interaction or less than additivity. RERI ranges from zero to infinity.

An AP[AB] of zero means no interaction or exactly additivity. An AP[AB] greater than zero means positive interaction or more than additivity. An AP[AB] of less than zero means negative interaction or less than additivity. AP[AB] ranges from -1 to +1.

The synergy index is the ratio of the combined effects and the individual effects. An S of one means no interaction or exactly additivity. An S of greater than one means positive interaction or more than additivity. An S of less than one means negative interaction or less than additivity. S ranges from zero to infinity.

In the absence of interaction AP[AB] = 0 and RERI and S = 1. 

Skrondal (2003) advocates for use of the synergy index as a summary measure of additive interaction, showing that when regression models adjust for the effect of confounding variables (as in the majority of cases) RERI and AP may be biased, while S remains unbiased.
                                                                                                         
This function uses the delta method to calculate the confidence intervals for each of the interaction measures, as described by Hosmer and Lemeshow (1992). An error will be returned if the point estimate of the synergy index is less than one. In this situation a warning is issued advising the user to re-parameterise their model as a linear odds model. See Skrondal (2003) for details.

A measure of multiplicative interaction is RR11 / (RR10 * RR01). If RR11 / (RR10 * RR01) equals one means no multiplicative interaction. If RR11 / (RR10 * RR01) is greater than one multiplicative interaction is said to be positive. If RR11 / (RR10 * RR01) is less than one multiplicative interaction is said to be negative.

## EXAMPLE 1:
## Data from Rothman and Keller (1972) evaluating the effect of joint exposure 
## to alcohol and tabacco on risk of cancer of the mouth and pharynx (cited in
## Hosmer and Lemeshow, 1992):

   rep(0, times = 12), rep(1, times = 8), rep(0, times = 3), rep(1, times = 18), 
   rep(0, times = 20))
alc <- c(rep(1, times = 409), rep(0, times = 49))
dat.df01 <- data.frame(alc, smk, can)

## EXAMPLE 2:
## Rothman defines an alternative coding scheme to be employed for
## parameterising an interaction term. Using this approach, instead of using
## two risk factors and one product term to represent the interaction (as 
## above) the risk factors are combined into one variable comprised of 
## (in this case) four levels:

## a.neg b.neg: 0 0 0
## a.pos b.neg: 1 0 0
## a.neg b.pos: 0 1 0
## a.pos b.pos: 0 0 1
